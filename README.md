# Kopher

Kopher is a clean-room implementation of [The Gopher Protocol RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1436)... in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). (#YOLO)

I am writing this purely as an excuse to learn the language and play with TDD (and, latterly, CI/CD and GitHub
workflows). I do not ever expect anyone to use it.

There's a high likelihood I'll get bored and move onto something else before it gets to the stage of being particularly
useful as an implementation.
